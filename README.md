## Overview

Flake ids are represented in 64-bit unsigned integers. Ids can be broken down into three components:

- Bucket: A 10-bit bucket id for sharding ids over 1024 different buckets.
- Timestamp: A 42-bit millisecond encoded timestamp of when the id was generated.
- Sequence: A 12-bit  incrementing sequence number that is reset at each timestamp increment.

With this formation, flake can generate 4096 unique ids per millisecond per bucket, or in other words, 4 **billion** unique ids per second. For reference, YouTube gets about 75 **thousand** unique views per second.
